# Temperature Converter
<h1>Temperature Converter</h1>

This is an app that converts between the major units of temperature.
<strong>Celcius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin</strong>.

It basically contains three input fields for these units.

When celcius gets an input - a value, it's simultaneously converted 
into Fahrenheits and Kelvin. Displayed in their respective inputs.

Same holds for other units.

When a temperature in Kelvin is input...others display it's equivalence
in their respective inputs.

I hope this help display my advance in knowledge of Vanilla JS.

Thanks for checking it out!

Kind regards,
